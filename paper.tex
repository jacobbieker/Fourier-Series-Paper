\section{Description}
Fourier series are expansions of periodic functions in terms of an infinite sum of sines and cosines.
It is a way to describe functions in a combination of simpler functions and
a way to make analysis of physical systems easier.

\section{Methods of Studying Fourier Series}\label{Description}
     Fast Fourier Transform, Discrete Fourier Transform, Discrete-time Fourier Transform, Z Transform, Convolution
     
\subsection{Fast Fourier Transformations}
\subsection{Discrete Fourier Transformation}
\subsection{Discrete-time Fourier Transform}
\begin{definition}
	The {\em Discrete-time Fourier Transform (DTFT)} can be defined as:
	$$X_{1/T}(f) = \mathcal{F}\left \{\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n] \cdot \delta(t-nT)\right \
	$$
\end{definition}
\subsection{Convolution}

\begin{definition}
     A {\em semi-quaver} is defined to be half a quaver.
\end{definition}

If that definition is not enough, here is another:

\begin{definition}
    The {\em order} of a note $n$ in a quaver $Q$,
    $O(n,Q)$, is defined by the equation
         $$ O(n,Q) = \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(n^{2} t)/(1-Qn) dt. $$
\end{definition}

Some equations one writes inline, such as
{\em Pythagoras' Theorem,}
$c^{2} = a^{2} + b^{2}$,
while others are better off as displayed
equations, like the quadratic formula,
  $$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}}{2a}$$
which solves the quadratic $ax^{2} + bx + c = 0$. If the quadratic
formula is written inline,
  $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}}{2a}$,
it is readable but not very nice.
This form,
  $x = (-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac})/2a$,
is harder to read as a fraction, but better because of the larger type.

Every inline equation must be part of a sentence:  Since $x < 1/2$ we have
$x + y < x + 1/2$.  Inline fractions, such as $x < \frac{1}{2}$, are discouraged but
not prohibited.


You can use formulae in theorems, as in the following.

\begin{theorem}\label{ContThrm}
    If $f(x)$ is defined by the equation
    \begin{equation}\label{SplitFunc}
         f(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{rl}
                          x^{2}, & \mbox{~for $x \geq 0$.} \\
                         -x^{2}, & \mbox{~for $x < 0$}
                         \end{array} \right.
   \end{equation}
   Then $f(x)$ is continuous at $x=0$.
\end{theorem}


\begin{proof}
    Since
          $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0^{-}} f(x) =
           \lim_{x \rightarrow 0^{-}} -x^{2} = 0$
    and
          $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0^{+}} f(x) =
           \lim_{x \rightarrow 0^{+}} x^{2} = 0$
    it follows that
         $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} f(x) = 0 = f(x)$,
         as required.
\end{proof}





   Did you notice the grammatical error in
   Theorem~\ref{ContThrm}?  The sentence leading
   into equation~\ref{SplitFunc} is never completed.
   %%%% Notice references are done with \ref
   %%%% you can label any structure that produces a number
   The following
   theorem is worded correctly.
\begin{theorem}
    If $f(x)$ is defined by the equation
    \begin{equation}
         f(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{rl}
                          x^{2}, & \mbox{~for $x \geq 0$} \\
                         -x^{2}, & \mbox{~for $x < 0$}
                         \end{array}\right.,
   \end{equation}
   then $f(x)$ is continuous at $x=0$.
\end{theorem}

   One rule of thumb of mathematical composition is to
   use mathematical notation inside sentences only for
   nouns.  For example, one writes that ``$R$ is the the
   radius of a circle'', but not that ``the radius of the
   circle ='s the side length of the square''.  According to
   this rule it is correct to write that
   ``$(x>0) \Rightarrow (x^{3} > 0)$'' since the double arrow is part of
   an equation, but not to write
   ``$x$ is positive $\Rightarrow$ $x^{3}$ is positive'', since the
   double arrow is acting as a verb.

Here is another kind of common structure:

\begin{theorem}
   The following are equivalent.
   \begin{enumerate}
      \item $a \leq b$
      \item $b \geq a$
      \item $a = b$ or $a<b$
   \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

And here is a typical matrix
 $$
 \left[
 \begin{array}{rrrrrrrr}
    0 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0  \\
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0  \\
    0 & 0 & \alpha & \alpha & -\alpha & -\alpha & 0 & 0  \\
    \alpha & \alpha & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -\alpha & -\alpha  \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0  \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & -1
 \end{array}
 \right]
 $$

For instance in Figure~\ref{ParabFig} the picture of the
parabola was produced in Maple
and saved as an epsf (eps) file, (pure ascii mode, no
preview, no thumbnail).
  \begin{figure}[htb]
      \centering
      \caption{$y = x^{2}$\label{ParabFig}}
  \end{figure}
When the document is processed, the .eps file must reside
in the same directory as the .tex file.  Also, the command
\verb2\usepackage{graphicx}2 should occur near the top of the document.
Notice that this figure has been scaled so that the overall size
is convenient (width 2.5 inches), but now the text is far too small.
To avoid this problem it is often best to
generate a figure which is approximately the same size as
it will appear in the document.

A complete source of information on writing documents
in \LaTeX is~\cite{MyFavorite}.  (Look in the source
so see how to produce that citation.)
Last of all is the style of the $\Pi$ME biliography:
Author's names in small caps, journal article titles
uncapitalized and in italics, book titles capitalized
and in quotes.

\section{Applications of Fourier Series}
It is used in proving the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem,
studying harmonic oscillations, waveforms, signal processing,
diffractions, interference, and Young's double slit experiment,
and Radiation from surface currents, supernovae simulations,
partial differential equations by separating variables,
solving the heat equation.

\subsection{Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem}
\begin{theorem}
	If a time-varying signal is periodically sampled at a rate of at least twice the frequency of the highest sinusoidal component contained within the signal, then the original time-varying signal can be exactly recovered from the periodic samples.
\end{theorem}
The theorem also explains why aliasing occurs if the discrete sampling frequency is not sufficiently high enough to capture all the changes in the signal. 
Fourier series comes into play in this theorem through breaking a signal into its component frequencies.
\subsection{Signal Processing}
In signal processing, the Fourier series, and especially the Fourier transform, is used to determine what frequencies are present in a signal, and in what proportions. The magnitude squared of the Fourier series of a given signal gives the amount of power the signal has at that particular frequency. The Fourier series also makes it easier for specific frequencies present in a signal to be blocked out, or nullified.
\subsection{Astrophysical Simulations}
As part of research I am conducting with Dr. James Imamura, where we simulate stars as they accumulate mass and become unstable, the Fourier series coefficients are graphed and examined to see how the simulation is going. As the star becomes more unstable, the first few terms grow larger and fluctuate more dramatically.
\subsection{Heat Equation}
Solving the heat equation was one of the first applications of the Fourier series, and is what Joseph Fourier proposed when first coming up with the Fourier series.

\subsection{Quantum Physics}
In quantum physics, the Fourier transform can be used with wavefunctions, as well as with the uncertainty principle to show that completely knowing the momentum of a particle means that the location is completely unknown, as well as the opposite. 

The Fourier transform is equivalent to splitting light into its component spectrum. It is also used to understand phenomena in optics and with light, such as Young's double slit experiment. For the double slit experiment, the Fourier transform of the transmission function gives the frequency content of the resultant wave, while the square of the Fourier transform gives the intensity of the pattern on the screen. The transform then describes the maxima and minima that occur from the double slit experiment correctly.

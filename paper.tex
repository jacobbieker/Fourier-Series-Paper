\section{Description}
Fourier series are expansions of periodic functions in terms of an infinite sum of sines and cosines.
It is a way to describe functions in a combination of simpler functions and
a way to make analysis of physical systems easier.

\begin{definition}
     A {\em semi-quaver} is defined to be half a quaver.
\end{definition}

If that definition is not enough, here is another:

\begin{definition}
    The {\em order} of a note $n$ in a quaver $Q$,
    $O(n,Q)$, is defined by the equation
         $$ O(n,Q) = \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(n^{2} t)/(1-Qn) dt. $$
\end{definition}

Some equations one writes inline, such as
{\em Pythagoras' Theorem,}
$c^{2} = a^{2} + b^{2}$,
while others are better off as displayed
equations, like the quadratic formula,
  $$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}}{2a}$$
which solves the quadratic $ax^{2} + bx + c = 0$. If the quadratic
formula is written inline,
  $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}}{2a}$,
it is readable but not very nice.
This form,
  $x = (-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac})/2a$,
is harder to read as a fraction, but better because of the larger type.

Every inline equation must be part of a sentence:  Since $x < 1/2$ we have
$x + y < x + 1/2$.  Inline fractions, such as $x < \frac{1}{2}$, are discouraged but
not prohibited.


You can use formulae in theorems, as in the following.

\begin{theorem}\label{ContThrm}
    If $f(x)$ is defined by the equation
    \begin{equation}\label{SplitFunc}
         f(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{rl}
                          x^{2}, & \mbox{~for $x \geq 0$.} \\
                         -x^{2}, & \mbox{~for $x < 0$}
                         \end{array} \right.
   \end{equation}
   Then $f(x)$ is continuous at $x=0$.
\end{theorem}


\begin{proof}
    Since
          $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0^{-}} f(x) =
           \lim_{x \rightarrow 0^{-}} -x^{2} = 0$
    and
          $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0^{+}} f(x) =
           \lim_{x \rightarrow 0^{+}} x^{2} = 0$
    it follows that
         $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} f(x) = 0 = f(x)$,
         as required.
\end{proof}





   Did you notice the grammatical error in
   Theorem~\ref{ContThrm}?  The sentence leading
   into equation~\ref{SplitFunc} is never completed.
   %%%% Notice references are done with \ref
   %%%% you can label any structure that produces a number
   The following
   theorem is worded correctly.
\begin{theorem}
    If $f(x)$ is defined by the equation
    \begin{equation}
         f(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{rl}
                          x^{2}, & \mbox{~for $x \geq 0$} \\
                         -x^{2}, & \mbox{~for $x < 0$}
                         \end{array}\right.,
   \end{equation}
   then $f(x)$ is continuous at $x=0$.
\end{theorem}

   One rule of thumb of mathematical composition is to
   use mathematical notation inside sentences only for
   nouns.  For example, one writes that ``$R$ is the the
   radius of a circle'', but not that ``the radius of the
   circle ='s the side length of the square''.  According to
   this rule it is correct to write that
   ``$(x>0) \Rightarrow (x^{3} > 0)$'' since the double arrow is part of
   an equation, but not to write
   ``$x$ is positive $\Rightarrow$ $x^{3}$ is positive'', since the
   double arrow is acting as a verb.

Here is another kind of common structure:

\begin{theorem}
   The following are equivalent.
   \begin{enumerate}
      \item $a \leq b$
      \item $b \geq a$
      \item $a = b$ or $a<b$
   \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

And here is a typical matrix
 $$
 \left[
 \begin{array}{rrrrrrrr}
    0 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0  \\
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0  \\
    0 & 0 & \alpha & \alpha & -\alpha & -\alpha & 0 & 0  \\
    \alpha & \alpha & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -\alpha & -\alpha  \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0  \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & -1
 \end{array}
 \right]
 $$


Sometimes you want to use a figure.

\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{SelfdualFig} was made (using TeXCad)
with the \LaTeX picture
environment.  Sometimes a figure is just too
complicated to draw with these simple commands.  In this case
we use epsf files.
For instance in Figure~\ref{ParabFig} the picture of the
parabola was produced in Maple
and saved as an epsf (eps) file, (pure ascii mode, no
preview, no thumbnail).
  \begin{figure}[htb]
      \centering
      \caption{$y = x^{2}$\label{ParabFig}}
  \end{figure}
When the document is processed, the .eps file must reside
in the same directory as the .tex file.  Also, the command
\verb2\usepackage{graphicx}2 should occur near the top of the document.
Notice that this figure has been scaled so that the overall size
is convenient (width 2.5 inches), but now the text is far too small.
To avoid this problem it is often best to
generate a figure which is approximately the same size as
it will appear in the document.

A complete source of information on writing documents
in \LaTeX is~\cite{MyFavorite}.  (Look in the source
so see how to produce that citation.)
Last of all is the style of the $\Pi$ME biliography:
Author's names in small caps, journal article titles
uncapitalized and in italics, book titles capitalized
and in quotes.

\section{Applications of Fourier Series}
It is used in proving the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem,
studying harmonic oscillations, waveforms, signal processing,
diffractions, interference, and Young's double slit experiment,
and Radiation from surface currents, supernovae simulations,
partial differential equations by separating variables,
solving the heat equation.

\subsection{Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem}
\subsection{Signal Processing}
\subsection{Astrophysical Simulations}
As part of research I am conducting with Dr. James Imamura, where we simulate stars as they accumulate mass and become unstable, the Fourier series coefficients are graphed and examined to see how the simulation is going. As the star becomes more unstable, the first few terms grow larger and fluctuate more dramatically.
